# DMDW_Mini_Projecct

## Problem Statement :
Choose any one topic from the following list:
1. Pre-processing
2. Frequent Pattern Mining Algorithms
3. Classification and
4. Clustering

From Python available datasets you can choose any dataset or you can choose any public dataset. Then select any topic from the above list. Apply various functions, algorithms available for that topic in Python library and produced your result. Generate comparative statement on all the methods that are used by you. 

## Approach :
### Topic Used : Classification
### Dataset USed : Iris and Red-Wine-Quality
### Algorithms Compared :
1. Support Vector Classifier (Linear SVM)
2. Support Vector Classifier (rbf SVM)
3. Decision Tree
4. Random Forest
5. Logistic Regression
6. Linear Discriminant Analysis
7. Gaussian Naive Bayes
8. XGBoost
9. K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)
10. Gradient Boosting Classifier

##### Performances on both the dataset for above algorithms were recorded in terms of "Accuracy". Please find the results and also the graphs for comparing the accuracies in their respective NoteBooks. 
##### (For the Red-Wine-Quality dataset, I have performed comparison between accuracies with MinMaxScaling, StandardScaling and without scaling. The results for the same can be found in "Wine_Mini_Project.ipynb" file)
